should i test as much data as i can, or just limit it so that one variable
changes at a time?

for example:
    train on warm (with hat and glasses), test on cold (with hat and glasses)
or instead:
    train on warm (with only vanilla), test on cold (with only vanilla)

using other positions could help too, but profiles might damage the results
