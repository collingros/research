Documentation for what I've been doing


before we can draw conclusions from whether certain lighting or positions can
be exploited by attackers to fool a recognition system, there are some settings
that need to be tuned such that the recognition system is performing its best
during the important testing.

to do this, i took note of the settings that were program-specific:
    casc (file used for the haar cascade classifier)
    sf (scale factor)
    mn (minimum neighbors)
    res (height of the resolution to resize to)

some constants were also used:
    all of the images in the dataset are presented in JPG with a ratio w/h of
    1:5. a res value of 480 represents the resolution (720 x 480)

after noting these, i collected training data from the program using many
variations of the program's variables:
    casc: lbph_frontal.xml, and haar_default.xml
    sf: 1.01, 1.05, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.5
    mn: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10
    res: 150, 480, 960, 1920, and 3456
